        "a": "The small compound occurs during fragmentation are different in both the cases. Fragmentation is based on the functional groups present in the molecule.",

        "a": "When hydrogen atom removed from the molecule",

        "a": "It will generate anion, which possesses a negative charge on the molecule. It wonâ€™t be useful in mass spectrometry for molecular mass descrimination or molecular mass identification.",
        "b": "It will also generate anion and is not useful in  mass spectrometry.",
        "c": "Only cations formed after electron removal are used in mass spectrometry to identify the molecular mass of a new molecule.",
