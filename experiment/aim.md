Mass spectroscopy is the most powerful technique to weigh the molar masses of a given molecule. It is useful in identifying unknown compounds and studying their molecular structure. The principle consists of ionizing the sample in the gas phase to form positively charged ion or radical ions and then measure the mass to charge ratio of all ions. It is largely used in industry and academia and finds application in chemistry, Biotechnology, pharmaceutical, environmental, Clinical, Geological fields. Different methods use different techniques for ionization, which in turn determines what types of samples can be analyzed by mass spectrometry. Of all available methods, Electron Ionisation or Impact mass spectroscopy is the simplest of all mass techniques that are widely used.

1. To understand the working principle of mass spectroscopy.
2. Structural determination of the given compound/sample by spectral analysis.
