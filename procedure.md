Follow the procedure given below once all the apparatus has been introduced into the workspace:

1. Click on the Solvent Beaker to draw 1 ml of the Solvent (methanol) and inject it into the spectrometer inlet to clean any impurity in the pathway of the mass spectrometer.
2. Click on the Sample Beaker to transfer a small amount (around 1mg) of the Sample substance into the empty Solution Beaker.
3. Click on the Solvent Beaker to transfer 5 ml of the Solvent (methanol) to the Solution Beaker.
4. Click on the Solution Beaker to shake it and make a clear solution.
5. Click on the Solution Beaker to draw 1 ml of the sample prepared to load onto the Mass Spectrometer.
6. Click on the Observe button in the Control Menu to observe what is happening inside the Mass Spectrometer.
7. Click on the Observe button again to view the Intensity graph plotted to determine the compound's molar mass.
8. Click on the Restart button in the Control Menu in order to repeat the entire experiment from scratch.
